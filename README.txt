Project for the NSLC major simulation

I attended the NSLC program in july 2022. For the final project, we had to do a major simulation 
on a chosen topic, which in our case was Netflix, and analyze some data using tools
they thought us in the program like python with the pandas library or simply excel sheets.

For the Netflix project we had to analyze the 3 packs of data provided to us (ratings.csv,
movies_metadata.csv and titles.csv) in order to determine which pair of actors would be 
beneficial if Netflix was planning to make a new movie. This election was done based on movie
popularity, positive income and best rated actors in the data provided. 

You can see our presentation in the 'NSLC Major Sim.pptx' file where we have all the graphs and
the final decision.
